# hello-world
My first GitHub repository.

My name is Kevin. I am learning to code in Python. I attended medical school for one year, only to decide it's not for me. I decided to step into the coding world for future employment, and I'm excited for the possibilities. I can program in C++, python, and I hope to improve my abilities.
